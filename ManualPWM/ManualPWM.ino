  ManualPWM

  This example shows how to create PWM by using the micros-function and avoiding analogWrite

  Using micros, there is no need using analogWrite, which overrides all pinmode-settings
  and thus disables any of the built-in pull-up resistors. Another advantage is that the
  code is free of delay-commands.

  Creating a manual PWM will still pulse bursts of 5v into your displays, which may
  lead to deterioration of the electrolyte and aging of the display.

  A variable using unsigned long to store the micros will overflow after approx. 70 minutes after 
  the Arduino started running.
