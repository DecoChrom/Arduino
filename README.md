# Arduino
Repository for Arduino code developed during the DecoChrom project

## Projects
- Simple: Automatically switches the polarity on two pins. The code uses delay to set the periods of on and off times.
- Advanced: Automatically switches the polarity on two pins. The code uses a timing algorithm to set the periods of on and off times allowing other code to run in between the switches. 
- ButtonSwitching: Button press switching project. Automatically switches polarity per press.
